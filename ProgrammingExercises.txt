Programming Exercises:
	1. write code that binary searches a list of ints
	2. write code that sorts a list of ints
		using selection sort
		using merge sort
		using quicksort
	3. implement a link list with the following operations:
		new list (init), append, append to beginning,
		delete from end, delete from front, add to arbitrary position,
		get data at arbitrary position in O(n)
	4. write code to reverse a linked list
	5. write code to insert into the list in sorted order,
		and write binary search to search your lists
