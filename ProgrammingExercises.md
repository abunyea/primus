Programming Exercises:
======================

1. Write code that binary searches a list of ints.
2. Write code that sorts a list of ints:
	* using selection sort
	* using merge sort
	* using quicksort
3. Implement a singly linked list with the following operations:
	* new list (init)
	* append, append to front, add to arbitrary position
	* delete from end, delete from front
	* get data at arbitrary position in O(n)
4. Write code to reverse a linked list
5. Write code to insert into the list in sorted order, and write binary search to search your lists
