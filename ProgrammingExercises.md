Programming Exercises:
======================
	1. write code that binary searches a list of ints
	2. write code that sorts a list of ints
		using selection sort
		using merge sort
		using quicksort
	3. implement a link list with the following operations:
		new list (init), append, append to beginning,
		delete from end, delete from front, add to arbitrary position,
		get data at arbitrary position in O(n)
	4. write code to reverse a linked list
	5. write code to insert into the list in sorted order,
		and write binary search to search your lists
	6. implement the last three exercises using doubly linked lists
	7. write code that prints out the Fibonacci sequence,
		recursively
		iteratively
	8. write a program that prints out the solution to the
		Towers of Hanoi problem
